  "content": "214.- (1) On hearing a winding-up petition the Court may dismiss it, or adjourn the hearing conditionally or unconditionally, or make any interim order, or any other order that it thinks fit, but the Court shall not refuse to make a winding-up order on the ground only that the assets of the company have been charged or mortgaged to an amount equal to or in excess of those assets or that the company has no assets. (2) Where the petition is presented by members of the company as contributories on the ground that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up, the Court, if it is of opinion,- (a) that the petitioners are entitled to relief either by winding up the company or by some other means; and (b) that in the absence of any other remedy it would be just and equitable that the company should be wound up, shall make a winding-up order, unless it is also of the opinion both that some other remedy is available to the petitioners and that they are acting unreasonably in seeking to have the company wound up instead of pursuing that other remedy. (3) Where the petition is presented on the ground of default in delivering the statutory report to the registrar or in holding the statutory meeting, the Court may- (a) instead of making a winding-up order, direct that the statutory report shall be delivered or that a meeting shall be held; and (b) order the costs to be paid by any persons who, in the opinion of the 207 Court, are responsible for the default. Power to stay or restrain proceedings against company."
