(2) For the purposes of this Law, it shall, unless the contrary is proved, be evidence that an allotment of, or an agreement to allot, shares or debentures was made with a view to the shares or debentures being offered for sale to the public if it is shown- (a) that an offer of the shares or debentures or of any of them for sale to the public was made within six months after the allotment or agreement to allot; or (b) that at the date when the offer was made the whole consideration to be received by the company in respect of the shares or debentures had not been so received. (3) Section 39 as applied by this section shall have effect as if it required a prospectus to state in addition to the matters required by that section to be stated in a prospectus- (a) the net amount of the consideration received or to be received by the company in respect of the shares or debentures to which the offer relates; and (b) the place and time at which the contract under which the said shares or debentures have been or are to be allotted may be inspected; and section 41 as applied by this section shall have effect as though the persons making the offer were persons named in a prospectus as directors of a company. 53 (4) Where a person making an offer to which this section relates is a company or a firm, it shall be sufficient if the document aforesaid is signed on behalf of the company or firm by two directors of the company or not less than half of the partners, as the case may be, and any such director or partner may sign by his agent authorized in writing. Interpretation of provisions relating to prospectuses."
