Tenth Schedule. (2) A winding up subject to the supervision of the Court is not a winding up by the Court for the purpose of the provisions of this Law specified in the Tenth Schedule, but, subject as aforesaid, an order for a winding up subject to supervision shall for all purposes be deemed to be an order for winding up by the Court: Provided that where the order for winding up subject to supervision was made in relation to a creditors' voluntary winding up in which a committee of inspection had been appointed, the order shall be deemed to be an order for winding up by the Court for the purpose of section 241 (except subsection (1) thereof) except in so far as the operation of this section is excluded in a voluntary winding up by general rules. (V) PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO EVERY MODE OF WINDING UP Proof and Ranking of Claims Debts of all descriptions may be proved."
