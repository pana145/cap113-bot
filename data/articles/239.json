(2) Where the release of a liquidator is withheld, the Court may, on the application of any creditor or contributory or person interested, make such order as it thinks just, charging the liquidator with the consequences of any act or default which he may have done or made contrary to his duty. 216 (3) An order of the Court releasing the liquidator shall discharge him from all liability in respect of any act done or default made by him in the administration of the affairs of the company or otherwise in relation to his conduct as liquidator, but any such order may be revoked on proof that it was obtained by fraud or by suppression or concealment of any material fact. (4) Where the liquidator has not previously resigned or been removed, his release shall operate as a removal of him from his office. Committees of Inspection Meetings of creditors and contributories to determine whether committee of inspection shall be appointed."
