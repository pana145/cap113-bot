(2) Shares to which a restricted right of participation in the distributions in the meaning of section 169A and/or in the distribution of the company assets in the case of liquidation is attached, shall not have a right of pre-emption. (3) When the company has different classes of shares, in which the right to vote or the right to participate in the distributions within the meaning of section 169A and/or in the distribution of the companyâ€™s assets in the case of liquidation are different between them, and the share capital is to be increased by the issuance of new shares of only one class of such classes, the memorandum or articles may allow the exercise of a right of pre-emption by the shareholders of the other classes only after the exercise of such right by the shareholders of the class from which the new shares are being issued.
