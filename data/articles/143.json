  "content": "143.- (1) The financial statements shall present a true and fair picture of the company (hereinafter called a “true and fair picture”). (2) The presentation of a true and fair picture shall be achieved through the strict application of the International Accounting Standards, the compliance with which is obligatory for all companies. (3) Where, in the opinion of the directors, compliance with the International Accounting Standards is not sufficient for the presentation of a true and fair picture, supplementary information must be provided in the notes. (4) If the financial statements presented or published do not present a true and fair picture, a contravention of this section shall be deemed to exist. To this, the fact that each separate action which has been carried out in compliance with the provisions of this section was, in itself, lawful, or that there was no liability as to the end result of the non presentation of a true and fair picture , cannot be used as an argument. (5) If a director of a company fails to take all reasonable measures to secure compliance with the provisions of this section, as well as with other requirements of this Law in relation to the matters which must be presented in the financial statements, shall commit an offence and on conviction thereof be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or to a fine not exceeding seventeen thousand and eighty-six euros or to both such penalties . 8 of 167(I) of 2003. 8 of 167 (I) of 2003. 8 of 167(I) of 2003. 8 of 167 (I) of 2003."
