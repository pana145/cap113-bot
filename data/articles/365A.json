(2) The appointment of an inspector under this section may define the scope of his investigation, whether as respects the matters or the period to which it is to extend or otherwise, and in particular may limit the investigation to matters connected with particular shares or debentures. (3) Where an application for an investigation under this section with respect to particular shares or debentures of a company is made to the Council of Ministers by members of the company, and the number of applicants or the amount of the shares held by them is not less than that required for an application for the appointment of an inspector under section 158, the Council of Ministers shall appoint an inspector to conduct the investigation unless he is satisfied that the application is vexatious, and the inspector's appointment shall not exclude from the scope of his investigation any matter which the application seeks to have included therein, except in so far as the Council of Ministers is satisfied that it is unreasonable for that matter to be investigated.

Power to impose restrictions on shares or debentures. 168.-(1) Where in connection with an investigation under section 166 or 167 it appears to the Council of Ministers that there is difficulty in finding out the relevant facts about any shares (whether issued or to be issued), and that the difficulty is due wholly or mainly to the unwillingness of the persons concerned or any of them to assist the investigation as required by this Law, the Council of Ministers may by order direct that the shares shall until further order be subject to the restrictions imposed by this section. (2) So long as any shares are directed to be subject to the restrictions imposed by this section- (a) any transfer of those shares, or in the case of unissued shares any transfer of the right to be issued therewith and any issue thereof, shall be void; (b) no voting rights shall be exercisable in respect of those shares; (c) no further shares shall be issued in right of those shares or in pursuance of any offer made to the holder thereof; (d) except in a liquidation, no payment shall be made of any sums due from the company on those shares, whether in respect of capital or otherwise.

(5) Any person who- (a) exercises or purports to exercise any right to dispose of any shares which, to his knowledge, are for the time being subject to the said restrictions or of any right to be issued with any such shares; or 149 (b) votes in respect of any such shares, whether as holder or proxy, or appoints a proxy to vote in respect thereof; or 3 of 166 of 1987. (c) being the holder of any such shares, fails to notify of their being subject to the said restrictions any person whom he does not know to be aware of that fact but does know to be entitled, apart from the said restrictions, to vote, in respect of those shares whether as holder or proxy, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or to a fine not exceeding one thousand, seven hundred and eight euros or to both such imprisonment and fine. 4 of 166 of 1987.

If part of the subscribed capital has not been called up, and the uncalled part does not appear in the assets shown in the balance sheet, then this part is not taken into account in the subscribed capital. (2) The amount of a distribution to shareholders cannot exceed the amount of the results of the last financial year, increased by the profits brought forward at the end of the last financial year and sums drawn from reserves available for this purpose, reduced however by the 150 amount of losses brought forward from previous financial years, and sums placed to reserve in accordance with the law or the articles of association.

(2) Any conveyance or assignment by a company of all its property to trustees for the benefit of all its creditors shall be void to all intents. Liabilities and rights of certain fraudulently preferred persons. 302.- (1) Where, in the case of a company wound up, anything made or done after the commencement of this Law is void under section 301 as a fraudulent preference of a person interested in property mortgaged or charged to secure the company's debt, then (without prejudice to any rights or liabilities arising apart from this provision) the person preferred shall be subject to the same liabilities, and shall have the same rights, as if he had undertaken to be personally liable as surety for the debt to the extent of the charge on the property or the value of his interest, whichever is the less. (2) The value of the said person's interest shall be determined as at the date of the transaction constituting the fraudulent preference, and shall be determined as if the interest were free of all in cumbrances other than those to which the charge for the company's debt was then subject. (3) On any application made to the Court with respect to any payment on the ground that the payment was a fraudulent preference of a surety or guarantor, the Court shall have jurisdiction to determine any questions with respect to the payment arising between the person to whom the payment was made and the surety or guarantor and to grant relief in respect thereof, notwithstanding that it is not necessary so to do for the purposes of the winding up, and for that purpose may give leave to bring in the surety or guarantor as a third party as in the case of an action for the recovery of the sum paid. This subsection shall apply, with the necessary modifications, in relation to transactions other than the payment of money as it applies in relation to payments. Effect of floating charge. 303.

(2) The disclaimer shall operate to determine, as from the date of disclaimer, the rights, interest and liabilities of the company, and the property of the company, in or in respect of the property disclaimed, but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company and the property of the company from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. (3) The Court, before or on granting leave to disclaim, may require such notices to be given to persons interested, and impose such terms as a condition of granting leave, and make such other order in the matter as the Court thinks just. (4) The liquidator shall not be entitled to disclaim any property under this section in any case where an application in writing has been made to him by any persons interested in the property requiring him to decide whether he will or will not disclaim and the liquidator has not, within a period of twenty-eight days after the receipt of the application or such further period as may be allowed by the Court, given notice to the applicant that he intends to apply to the Court for leave to disclaim, and, in the case of a contract, if the liquidator, after such an application as aforesaid, does not within the said period or further period disclaim the contract, the company shall be deemed to have adopted it. (5) The Court may, on the application of any person who is, as against the liquidator, entitled to the benefit or subject to the burden of a contract made with the company, make an order rescinding the contract on such terms as to payment by or to either party of damages for the non- performance of the contract, or otherwise as the Court thinks just, and any damages payable under the order to any such person may be proved by him as a debt in the winding up. (6) The Court may, on an application by any person who either claims any interest in any disclaimed property or is under any liability not discharged by this Law in respect of any disclaimed property and on hearing any such persons as it thinks fit, make an order for the vesting of the property in or the delivery of the property to any persons entitled thereto, or to whom it may seem just that the property should be delivered by way of compensation for such liability as aforesaid, or a trustee for him, and on such terms as the Court thinks just, and on any such vesting order being made, the property comprised therein shall vest accordingly in the person therein named in that behalf without any conveyance or assignment for the purpose: 239 Provided that, where the property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature, the Court shall not make a vesting order in favour of any person claiming under the company except upon the terms of making that person- (a) subject to the same liabilities and obligations as those to which the company was subject under the lease in respect of the property at the commencement of the winding up; or (b) if the Court thinks fit, subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had been assigned to that person at that date, and in either event, if the case so requires, as if the lease had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order, and any mortgagee or under-lessee declining to accept a vesting order upon such terms shall be excluded from all interest in and security upon the property, and, if there is no person claiming under the company who is willing to accept an order upon such terms, the Court shall have power to vest the estate and interest of the company in the property in any person liable either personally or in a representative character, and either alone or jointly with the company, to perform the lessee's covenants in the lease, freed and discharged from all estates, incumbrances and interests created therein by the company. (7) Any person injured by the operation of a disclaimer under this section shall be deemed to be a creditor of the company to the amount of the injury, and may accordingly prove the amount as a debt in the winding up.

(2) For the purpose of this section, an execution against goods shall be taken to be completed by seizure and sale, and an attachment of a debt shall be deemed to be completed by receipt of the debt, and an execution against immovable property shall be deemed to be completed by making the judgment a charge on the immovable property.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), where under an execution in respect of a judgment for a sum exceeding two hundred thirteen euros the goods of a company are sold or money is paid in order to avoid sale, the sheriff shall deduct the costs of the execution from the proceeds of the sale or the money paid and retain the balance for fourteen days, and if within that time notice is served on him of a petition for the winding up of the company having been presented or of a meeting having been called at which there is to be proposed a resolution for the voluntary winding up of the company and an order is made or a resolution is passed, as the case may be, for the winding up of the company, the sheriff shall pay the balance to the liquidator, who shall be entitled to retain it as against the execution creditor.
