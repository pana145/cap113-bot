(2) A company that acquires shares in the cases mentioned in sub- paragraphs (b) to (f) of paragraph (1) of this section proceeds with their transfer within a time limit of three years at the latest from the time of their acquisition, except if the nominal value of the shares which have been acquired in this way, including the shares that the company has acquired from a person acting in his name, but on the companyâ€™s 71 behalf, does not exceed ten per cent (10%) of the subscribed capital. (3) In case the shares in question have not been transferred within the time-limit specified in paragraph (2) above, these are cancelled by reducing the subscribed capital by the corresponding amount: 7 of 87(I) of 2008. Provided that this reduction is necessary to the extent that the acquisition of the shares which must be cancelled had the result of reducing the net assets of the company to an amount lower than that of the subscribed capital, increased by the stock of which this Law does not allow distribution. The amount of the aforementioned subscribed share capital shall be reduced by the amount of the share capital that has been covered, but has not yet been contributed when the former does not appear in the balance sheet. Obligation of company to transfer shares acquired in contravention of this Law. 2 of 135(I) of 2000."
